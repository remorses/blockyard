Stop zooming. Let's meet in the blockyard instead.

What is the blockyard?

It's Zuck metaverse but in **not minecraft™️ but similar game for trademark reasons** and using the browser instead of weird glasses.

pages to add

-   index, should be a landing page in windows 98 style, the hero should be a video showing how this thing works and a bug button called "enter the blockyard"
-   /user,
    -   "your personal world", show the link blockyard.app/world/username. the username is taken from google username and in lowercase, with added random hashes if the username is already taken.
        - copy link
        - start meeting
    -   Join a different world
        - open a modal where you paste the link or world code, simply redirect to that link
-  /world/username
    - if the user is logged in and part of this world, let him join
    - if not logged in, show a button "login with google to enter the world"
    - if logged in and not part of the world, show a button "knock knock"
        - show the host a message "someone is knocking" with button "let join" or "block"
        - if let him join, add the user in the worldUsers
    - if the world does not exist, show a message saying this world does not exist.
